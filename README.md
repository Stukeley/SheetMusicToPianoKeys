# Sheet Music to Piano Keys

A simple, text-based tool used to convert sheet music to piano keys.

## Why?

Are you a beginner, learning to play the piano or the keyboard and struggling to read sheet music? Do you find yourself constantly looking at the keys in the sheet music software only to answer the question "which key is this"?

Well, I certainly do. So I made this tool to help me with that.

## What?

This simple, console-based tool will parse a MXL (MusicXML) file and output the keys to be played for both hands.

What can you do with the keys?

- Memorize them and start learning a new song right away
- Write them down on the sheet with notes, so that you can easily read them during practice
- Or just follow along and learn to quickly read notes based on key signature and/or position on the staff

## How?

1. You need to download an MXL file from any sheet music website (eg. MuseScore).
2. Copy the path of the file.
3. Run the program. Answer if you want piano or keyboard notation (whether middle C is C3 or C4).
4. Paste the path of the file.
5. The program will output the piano keys for both hands. The keys will be correct for the key signature and the position on the staff. (For example, if the key signature is G major, then F will automatically be F#, unless it's natural).
